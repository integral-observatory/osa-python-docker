# INTEGRAL OSA including Python and HEASoft (with pyXSpec)


[![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/integralsw/osa-python.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/integralsw/osa-python/)

this is a version of the [official OSA docker](https://gitlab.astro.unige.ch/savchenk/osa-docker/), but with recent python version.

heasoft needs to be re-built with python, hence the image built may take a while.

to test 

```bash
$ make pull
$ make test
```

To run an interactive jupyter lab:

```bash
$ make run
```

## Image Contents

* A latest Python version, currently 3.12
* OSA
* HEASoft, usually the latest version. Note that some OSA tools related to response matrix rebinning for ISGRI and JEM-X as well as standard ISGRI and JEM-X pipelines are not compatible with HEASoft versions newer than 6.28.

## What is not inside:

components which evolve at a much higher pace than the omage content, are not included and should be synced or mounted separately.

* **INTEGRAL data archive**: it should be accessed remotely FTP, HTTP, rsync, or APIs.
* **INTEGRAL IC tree**: latest version should be synced in shared area.
* **example notebooks**: since they are rapidly evolving and are contributed by different members.

# Using the OSA Python interative environment

Notebooks for use in the jupyter lab are not included. A diverse set of examples is available here:

# Consideration of Reproducibility

Interactive workflows (even in repeatable/reproducible environment) can not be sticktly repeatable/reproducible, since they depend on the human input. What consituties input may vary. In this image, we consider cloning repositories with well-defined and tracked notebooks to be user input. Hence, the fact that notebooks are not in the image does not make the workflows relying on it less reproducibly.
